 From my part (I was responsible for the Python wrappers) I'm ok with =20
any "open" or "free" licensing, I'm not too religious about it and =20
definitely want people to make use of it if they find it useful in any =20
way.

I'm quite sure that if you ask in the googlecode group the other =20
(current) developers will agree.
