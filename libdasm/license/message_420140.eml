Hi!

From my point of view, I see no problem in releasing this with some
BSD-style license. And I'm sure the other guys are with me in this...
The only problem here is that I'm not developing libdasm actively
anymore and I know it's lacking some essential features, like amd64
support.

But, the original "license" still holds, you can include it in Fedora
if you want to, but libdasm support is very limited (=3D non-existing)
from my side ;-).
