 Some sites require authentication, and skipfish supports this in different ways. First there is basic HTTP authentication, for which you can use the \-A flag. Second, and more common, are sites that require authentication on a web application level. For these sites, the best approach is to capture authenticated session cookies and provide them to skipfish using the \-C flag (multiple if needed). Last, you'll need to put some effort in protecting the session from being destroyed by excluding logout links with \-X and/or by rejecting new cookies with \-N.
 
 .IP "-F/--host <ip:hostname>"
-Using this flag, you can set the \'\fIHost:\fP\' header value to define a custom mapping between a host and an IP (bypassing the resolver). This feature is particularly useful for not-yet-launched or legacy services that don't have the necessary DNS entries.

 When it comes to customizing your HTTP requests, you can also use the -H option to insert any additional, non-standard headers. This flag also allows the default headers to be overwritten.

 This flag can be used to add a cookie to the skipfish HTTP requests; This is particularly useful to perform authenticated scans by providing session cookies. When doing so, keep in mind that cetain URLs (e.g. /logout) may destroy your session; you can combat this in two ways: by using the -N option, which causes the scanner to reject attempts to set or delete cookies; or by using the -X option to exclude logout URLs.
 
 .IP "-b/--user-agent <i|f|p>"
-This flag allows the user-agent to be specified where \'\fIi\fP\' stands for Internet Explorer, \'\fIf\fP\' for Firefox and \'\fIp\fP\' for iPhone. Using this flag is recommended in case the target site shows different behavior based on the user-agent (e.g some sites use different templates for mobiles and desktop clients).

 .IP "-N/--reject-cookies"
-This flag causes skipfish to ignore cookies that are being set by the site. This helps to enforce stateless tests and also prevent that cookies set with \'-C\' are not overwritten.
